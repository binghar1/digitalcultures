			<p><blockquote>There’s power in these Black Twitter streets…motivating masses to do anything creates something. There’s always results. A lot of times on Twitter there are just a lot of words, but then something gets done. Someone once told me, <q>your greatest resources in life are people,</q> and that’s especially true of Black Twitter, because we don’t do a lot in life to motivate each other. People reach people to get things done. If you reach a lot of people, you can get things done via Twitter.</blockquote>—<a href="https://twitter.com/PresidentialHB">@PresidentialHB</a> (personal communication, 2014)</p>			<p>Thanks to the curiosity and extended gaze of mainstream mass media producers, <b>Black Twitter</b> has been definitively framed for its ability to “get things done” through online conversation. Black Twitter forms its own hashtag public through an ongoing process of self- and group-identity maintenance, using hashtagged tweets to set boundaries of inclusion and articulate its values. These users, standouts among the 26% of all African Americans who use the Internet, have often been characterized as a digital mob. Using online messaging to draw attention to news of interest to Black communities in the United States, these users participate in what <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838151.2012.732147">Brock</a> describes as <b>cultural conversation</b> — engaging in the banal, chatting about television shows, and notably, lampooning and lambasting offenders. Their communicative acts contribute to an ever-evolving sense of community. Via everyday conversation and the use of hashtags as communication performance, these communicators act and react with one another rather than with an imagined audience, as scholars from <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2259-imagined-communities">Anderson</a> to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810365313">Marwick & boyd</a> have previously described.</p>
