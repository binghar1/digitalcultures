			<p>A recent <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_big_data_and_privacy_-_may_2014.pdf"> White House report on <b>‘big data’</b></a> concludes, <q>The technological trajectory, however, is clear: more and more data will be generated about individuals and will persist under the control of others</q>. Reading this statement brought to mind a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/184446/googles_schmidt_roasted_for_privacy_comments.html">2009 interview with Google Chairperson Eric Schmidt</a> when the public first discovered that Google retained individual search histories that were also made available to state security and law enforcement agencies, <q>If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place, but if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time … It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities</q>. What these two statements share is the attribution of agency to ‘technology.’ ‘Big data’ is cast as the inevitable consequence of a technological juggernaut with a life of its own entirely outside the social. We are but bystanders.</p>
