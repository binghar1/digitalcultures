			<p><cite>Habitual New Media</cite> counters this trend to analyze the present through soothsaying by revealing that <strong>our media matter most when they seem not to matter at all</strong>, that is, when they have moved from the new to the habitual. Search engines are hardly new or exciting, but they have become the default mode of knowledge acquisition. Smart phones no longer amaze, but they increasingly structure and monitor the lives of their so-called owners. Further, sites that have long since disappeared or which ‘we’ think have, such as Friendster.com (as of 2015, it was mainly a South Asian gaming site), live on in our clicks and our habitual actions, such as ‘friending.’ Whether or not a virus spreads depends on habits, from the regular washing of hands to practicing safe sex. <strong>Through habits users become their machines</strong>: they stream, update, capture, upload, share, grind, link, verify, map, save, trash, and troll. <a href="https://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/id/eprint/20101/">Repetition breeds expertise, even as it breeds boredom</a>.</p>
